## 🧱 Create a New React App (If Starting Fresh)

If you are starting a new React project:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

> Replace `my-app` with your desired project name.

---

## 📦 Clone Existing React Project

If you're working with an existing project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-frontend-project.git
cd your-frontend-project
```

> Replace the URL with your actual GitHub HTTPS link.

---

## 📥 Install Dependencies

Install all required packages listed in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 📚 Install Additional Packages

If the project uses packages like **React Router DOM**, install them using:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
npm install axios
npm install bootstrap
npm install validator
npm install react-toastify
npm install web-vitals
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Frontend App

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the app at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Open it in your browser to see the frontend.

## 🛠️ Common NPM Scripts

```bash
npm run build     # Create production-ready build
npm test          # Run tests
npm run lint      # Run linter (if configured)
```

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **npm not recognized?** Restart the terminal or system.
- **Dependency errors?** Try `npm install` again or delete `node_modules` and run `npm install`.
- **Port already in use?** Change the port in `.env` or kill the process using it.
